    <title>Block vs Inline Elements</title>
</head>
<body>

    <div>This is a block element. It takes up the whole width and pushes other content below it.</div>
    <p>This is another block element. It behaves the same way as the div, starting on a new line.</p>
    <header>This is a block element too. It's often used for headings or sections.</header>

    <span>This is an inline element. It only takes as much space as its content.</span>
    <a href="#">This is another inline element. It stays on the same line as other content.</a>
    <strong>This is an inline element as well. It just highlights text without breaking the line.</strong>
